# Bling

The primary purpose of this app was to become familiar with SpringBoot, but I also find 
it a useful budgeting tool.

The back-end is stored in [Airtable](https://airtable.com), while the front-end is a visualization
 of your current budget categories using [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/).
 

A functional demo is deployed to Heroku at [https://cmikeb1-bling.herokuapp.com/](https://cmikeb1-bling.herokuapp.com/).  
Feel free to poke around and make some transactions.

FYI: I'm using the free tier of Airtable which has an API limit. If the app fails to open, that is 
likely the cause.
